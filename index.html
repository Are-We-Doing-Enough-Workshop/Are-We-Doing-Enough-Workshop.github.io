                <div class="content">
                    <p>Constructing low volume and open source hardware devices is a hugely challenging task. Many steps in these processes lack proper support, and where solutions do exist their impact is difficult to measure. There are often significant educational, institutional and socio-economic barriers to access that may have to be navigated by those looking for help and guidance when producing their own devices.</p>
                    <p>This workshop will explore and assess the methods and efficacy of information sharing and education tools in the hardware space; is the community doing enough to ensure that information is accessible, understandable, effective and (most importantly) utilising the best channels to reach the widest audience? We will examine industrial, academic and social spheres to construct a multidimensional image of where help can be found, what help is out there, and how it can be put to its best use.</p>

                    <p>Accepted participants will be asked to submit a single slide with some key biographical and professional information about themselves for the Welcome activity. We will also host a pre-workshop "online cafe" on a dedicated online channel (e.g. Discord) for participants to introduce themselves and consider key topics they may wish to discuss in each session.</p>

                                <h4>Scoping the Needs of the Hardware Designer</h4>
                                <p>Participants will spend some time discussing in small groups before bringing together as a whole the stages of hardware development and the different facets of design that need to be considered when addressing the problem of guidance-seeking.</p>

                                <p>Using the established needs in the previous activity, participants will discuss in small groups where they believe the most comprehensive and effective guidance for each need exists in the physical or online world. These ideas will then be used to construct a "map" (via a digital Miro board) that represents the workshop's understanding of the ways in which a designer can seek help at various stages of the device design and production process.</p>

                                <h4>Utilising Mapped Channels of Information Sharing</h4>
                                <p>Following the "mapped" representation of information sharing channels, participants will discuss ways in which these channels are currently utilised by academia, industry and the hobbyist communities in different ways.

                                <p>Participants would then be invited to "sit back and reflect" upon the previous activities and pose questions for the hardware community on how ideas can best be shared. This would be an open-ended discussion driven primarily by the topics brought up over the course of the previous session, with the aim to provide tangible feedback and future work based on the outcomes of the mapping exercises.</p>
